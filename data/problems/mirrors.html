<p>Hard work pays off!
    Torbjorn has equipped his turret with Winston's lightning gun.
    He enters a room with mirrors on the walls and places the turret near the
    enemy Sombra's teleporter device. When Sombra teleports, the turret will
    trigger the lightning gun to send out electricity in every direction. The
    lightning bolts have a maximum range R meters traveled after leaving the
    turret.
    </p>

<p>
  Torbjorn wants to know: for a given room, turret position, and sombra
  position, and range R, how many beams will hit Sombra? Assume that a beam
  hitting a vertical/horizontal wall exactly inverts the vertical/horizontal
  component of the beam's velocity, respectively.
  </p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>
  The first line contains two positive integers: the width and height of the room.
  The second line contains two positive integers: the 0-indexed x and y position of Torbjorn's turret.
  The third line contains two positiive integers: the 0-indexed x and y position of Sombra's teleporter.
  The fourth and final line contains one non-negative float: the maximum distance a beam can travel.
</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>Print a single integer: the number of angles which the turret can fire a beam
  and hit Sombra. Note: if a beam hits the turret or Sombra, it stops there.
  You cannot have a beam continue through an object then hit something else
  behind it.<p>
