<p>There are N weights and a balance scale sitting on a table in front of you.
  N-1 of the weights weigh 10 grams, but 1 of them weighs 11 grams. Ultimately,
  your goal is to determine which weight is the one that is 11 grams.</p>

<p>You can place any number of weights on the left and right sides of the scale
  (but you must place the same number on both the left and right side). Assume
  you place M weights on the left, M on the right, and leave N-2M on the table:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the scale leans left, you know the heavier weight is one of the M on the left.</li>
  <li>If the scale leans left, you know the heavier weight is one of the M on the right.</li>
  <li>If the scale stays balanced, you know the heaver weight is one of the N-2M on the table.
</ol>

<p>Given a number of weights 1 <= N <= 2000, you want to find the 11 gram weight
  using the scale as few times as possible. What is the most times you must use
  the scale?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The first line will contain <em>T</em> - the number of test cases to follow.
  Each of the <em>T</em> remaining lines will contain a singular number
  <em>N</em> - the number of weights on the table.

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>For each test case, print a single number on its own line: the maximum number
  of times you must use the scale if you employ an optimal strategy.</p>

<div class="descriptionIO">
  <pre>
4
1
2
5
9
  </pre>
  <pre>
1
1
2
2
  </pre>
</div>

<p>For the third test case (N = 5), the optimal strategy is to first place 2
  weights on the left side and 2 weights on the right side. If the scale tips,
  you must use the scale one more time to determine which of the 2 on that side
  it is. If it does not tip, then you know it is the 1 that you did not place on
  the scale.</p>
