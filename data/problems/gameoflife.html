    Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automata which displays interesting
    phenomena. By using only a few simple rules it manages to create chaotic
    results. Surprisingly, it's also Turing complete, which means that anything
    that can be computed on a Turing machine can also be computed in Conway's
    Game of Life. As a result, you want to make a brand new programming language
    based on Conway's Game of Life, but first, you need to create a program that
    can simulate the game.

<p>
    The game takes place on a grid of cells called the universe with each cell
    being in one of two states: alive or dead. Each cell has neighbors, which
    are cells horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. Each tick, the
    universe updates based on a few simple rules:
    <ul>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused
            by underpopulation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
            generation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
            overpopulation.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live
            cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
    </ul>
    For the purposes of your programming language, all cells outside the
    universe are considered dead.

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>
    The first line will contain three integers, the width <em>W</em> and height
    <em>H</em> of the universe and the number of ticks <em>T</em> to compute in
    the future. The next <em>H</em> lines will contain the initial state of the
    universe. A "." represents a dead cell and a "+" represents a living cell.
</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>
    The output will be the universe at <em>T</em> ticks in the future.
