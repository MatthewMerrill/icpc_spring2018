<p>The purpose of this practice problem is to make sure your team is familiar
  with the procedures for creating, compiling, executing, and submitting a
  program to the Contest Judges. Your team is to write a program to solve the
  problem stated below.</p>

<p>
  Since this is a practice (it does not count in the real contest standings), it
  is suggested that you use it to familiarize yourself with all aspects of the
  contest environment. For example, try submitting a program which fails to
  compile, or which compiles but intentionally does NOT produce the correct
  result (so you see what will happen if this occurs in the real contest).</p>

<p>You should also use the practice session to familiarize yourself with the 2PC
  "Clarification Request" system. However, be aware that the Judges will be busy
  during the actual contest. Furthermore, please do NOT submit multiple queries
  to the Judges during the practice unless you really have a request for
  clarification about the practice problem itself.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement:</h4>

<p>Write a program to read a set of integers from standard input, one integer
  per line. For each integer N that is not equal to 0, the program should print
  (to the "standard output" device) a single output line containing two values:
  the input value N, appropriately labeled, followed by the value which is the
  sum of all integers between 1 and N, inclusive, also appropriately labeled.
  Continue reading input integers and printing output lines until an input value
  of 0 is encountered.</p>

<p>Below is a sample case. Throughout the competition, you will see this
  format used often. For each sample case, the left box will represent the
  content sent to your program over "standard input". The right box shows what
  a correct program will print to "standard output" for that case.</p>

<div class="descriptionIO">
  <pre>
3
6
0
  </pre>
  <pre>
N = 3    Sum = 6
N = 6    Sum = 21
  </pre>
</div>
