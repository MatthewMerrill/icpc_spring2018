<p>
    You are the head of the Scale Balancing Commission (SBC), an organization
    in charge of making sure that scales are made to specification and will
    stay level when loaded with various sets of equal weights. Your
    organization has a respectable set of weights which it uses to test scales.
    However, you believe you can save operating costs by cutting down on the
    number of weights used for each test while keeping the total weights on
    both sides equal.
</p>
<p>
    For each test, the SBC uses <em>N<sub>L</sub></em> weights that weigh
    <em>W<sub>L</sub></em> grams on the left dish and <em>N<sub>R</sub></em>
    weights that weigh <em>W<sub>R</sub></em> grams on the right dish. You
    believe that you can reduce the number of weights used on each side while
    still using only weights that weigh <em>W<sub>L</sub></em> and
    <em>W<sub>R</sub></em> grams on the left and right dishes respectively.
</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>
    The first line will contain the number of test cases <em>T</em>. Following
    will be <em>T</em> lines each containing four integers: <em>N<sub>L</sub></em>,
    <em>N<sub>R</sub></em>, <em>W<sub>L</sub></em>, and <em>W<sub>R</sub></em>.
</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>
    For each test case, print out two numbers on the same line: The minimum,
    non-zero number of weights that can be put on the left side and the
    minimum, non-zero number of weights that can be put on the right side such
    that the scale will stay balanced.
</p>
<p>
    If the number of weights cannot be reduced, print out to a single line: "The
    number of weights cannot be reduced."
