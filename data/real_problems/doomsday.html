<p>
  Mr. Big-bad has started the timer for his Big-bad Doomsday Device<sup>(tm)</sup>.
  Thankfully, he left (scattered throughout the continental United States) buttons that delay the explosion of the Big-bad Doomsday Device<sup>(tm)</sup>.
  You know where they all are, but you can't press the same button twice in a row. Also, you are the only one that can press the buttons. For... reasons...</p>

 <p>
  Your job is to save Earth by finding a way to indefinitely delay the device. Find a sequence of button presses that will accomplish this (accounting for the time it takes to travel in between each button).</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>
  The first line will be 3 space-separated integers:
  the number of buttons (which is <= 10),
  the amount of time left on the timer, and
  your starting location.</p>

<p>
  The following lines will each contain 3 space-separated integers:
  the location of the button you will travel from,
  the location of the button you will travel to, and
  the net effect on the doomsday timer in minutes to travel to and press the button
  (negative values add time back onto the timer).
  <p>
<p>
  When you get to a line that is only "-1", that is the last line of input.
  This line is only to signify the end of input.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>
  If you can find a path such that when you make one cycle of that path, the
  timer on the Big-bad Doomsday Device<sup>(tm)</sup> is increased or unchanged,
  and the timer never went to or below zero after pressing any button traveling
  to or repeating the cycle, print: "I can save the world".
  Otherwise, print: "The world is doomsdayed".
