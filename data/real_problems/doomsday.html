<p>
  Mr. Big-bad has started the timer for his Big-bad Doomsday Device<sup>(tm)</sup>.
  Thankfully, he left (scattered throughout the continental United States) buttons that delay the explosion of the Big-bad Doomsday Device<sup>(tm)</sup>.
  You know where they all are, but you can't press the same button twice in a row. Also, you are the only one that can press the buttons. For... reasons...</p>
 
 <p>
  Your job is to save Earth by finding a way to indefinitely delay the device. Find a sequence of button presses that will accomplish this (accounting for the time it takes to travel in between each button).</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>
  The first line will be 3 space-separated integers:
  The number of buttons.
  The amount of time left on the timer.
  Your starting location.
  The follwing lines will contain 3 space-separated integers. 
  The location of the button you will travel from.
  The location of the button you will travel to.
  The total cost in time it takes to travel to and press the button.
  <p>

<p>
  When you get to a line that is only "-1", that is the last line of input. This line is only to signify the end of input. To be clear, the cost to to travel an edge to a button to press is instantaneous at the time of traveling that path, and end at the time of pressing the button. The maximum number of buttons is 10. There is no need to worry about the time of the buttons.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>
  If you can find a path such that when you make one cycle of that path, the
  timer on the Big-bad Doomsday Device<sup>(tm)</sup> is increased, and the timer
  never went below zero while on the path, or traveling to that path, then print: "I can save the world".
  Otherwise, print: "The world is doomsdayed".
