<p>Hard work pays off!
    Torbjorn has equipped his turret with a laser-emitting stun gun.
    He enters a room with mirrors on the walls and places the turret near the
    enemy Sombra's teleporter device. When Sombra teleports, the turret will
    trigger and shoot a beam of elecctricity to try to stun the Sombra.
    The laser beams have a maximum range R meters traveled after leaving the
    turret.
    </p>

<p>
  Torbjorn wants to know: for a given room, turret position, sombra
  position, and range R, how many angles exist such that a beam fired in that
  direction would hit Sombra? Assume that a beam
  hitting a vertical/horizontal wall exactly inverts the vertical/horizontal
  component of the beam's velocity, respectively.
  </p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>
  The first line contains two positive integers: the width and height of the room.
  The second line contains two positive integers: the x and y position of Torbjorn's turret in meters.
  The third line contains two positiive integers: the x and y position of Sombra's teleporter in meters.
  The fourth and final line contains one non-negative float: the maximum distance a beam can travel in meters.
</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>Print a single integer: the number of angles which the turret can fire a beam
  and hit Sombra. Note: if a beam hits the turret or Sombra, it stops there.
  You cannot have a beam continue through an object then hit something else
  behind it. Also, both objects are considered to have no "width". For a beam to
  hit the object, it must be aimed exactly at the colliding object's
  location in the room.</p>
