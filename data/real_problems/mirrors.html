<p>Hard work pays off!
    Torbjorn has equipped his turret with a laser-emitting stun gun.
    He enters a room with mirrors on the walls and places the turret near the
    enemy Sombra's teleporter device. When Sombra teleports, the turret will
    trigger and shoot a laser beam to try to stun the Sombra.
    The laser beams have a maximum range R meters traveled after leaving the
    turret.
    </p>

<p>
  Torbjorn wants to know: for a given room, turret position, sombra
  position, and range R, how many angles exist such that a beam fired in that
  direction would hit Sombra? Assume that a beam travels straight except
  hitting a vertical/horizontal wall exactly inverts the vertical/horizontal
  component of the beam's velocity, respectively.
  </p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>Input consists of four lines:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Two positive integers: the width and height of the room</li>
  <li>Two positive integers: the x and y position of Torbjorn's turret</li>
  <li>Two positiive integers: the x and y position of Sombra</li>
  <li>One non-negative float: the maximum distance a beam can travel</li>
</ol>

<p>The turret and Sombra will always be at least one unit away from all walls,
  and will never share the same location.
</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>Print a single integer: the number of angles which the turret can fire a beam
  and hit Sombra.</p>

<p>Note: if a beam hits the turret or Sombra, it stops there.
  You cannot have a beam continue through an object then hit something else
  behind it. Also, both objects are considered to have no "width". For a beam to
  hit the object, it must be aimed exactly at the colliding object's
  location in the room.</p>

  For first sample case, the room is 5x6. T marks the turret at 1, 1 and S marks
  Sombra at 4, 5. Sombra is exactly sqrt(3*3 + 4*4) = 5 units from the turret,
  so a direct laser beam fire can reach her but no other angles can.
