<p>The great classical composer Johann Sebastian Bach used to compose their compositions using a technique called a fugue.
  There are many types of fugues. Repeating a string of notes but in a different octave(the same notes are played but in a different pitch) is one type of fugue.
  Repeating a string of notes backwards is also a fugue.
  Combining multiple fugue techniques is also a fugue.</p>

<p>You need to write a program that can detect if two phrases of notes are one of these fugues.<p>

<ol>
<li>The notes are the same but the entire string is shifted to a different octave.</li>
<li>The notes are reversed.</li>
<li>Both a and b.</li>
</ol>

<p>For this problem, notes will be represented by an integer. There are only 8 notes (1-8), but many octaves.
  So 1 is the same note as 9 and 17, etc. A 0 means that no note is played at that time (a rest).</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>
  The first input will be the number of notes in each phrase, N.
  The second line will be a list of N space-separated integers between 0 and 72 representing the first phrase of notes, P<sub>1..N</sub>.
  The third line will be a string of N space-separated integers between 0 and 72 representing the second phrase of notes, F<sub>1..N</sub>.
  1 <= N <= 8, and the non-rest notes of each phrase will share the same octave.
</p>


<h4>Output</h4>
<p>If the second phrase is a fugue of the first print "true"; if it's not, print "false".</p>
