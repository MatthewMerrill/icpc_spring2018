<p>You have been hired to write a simulation program for Riverside Hall's legendary elevators! Your simulator will be fed a list of instructions on how the elevators are to move and should print a graphic showing the elevator's positions at the end.</p>
<p>Riverside contains two elevators, designated "A" and "B". Your simulator should keep track of the floor that each elevator rests on. The elevators both start off at the ground (0<sup>th</sup>) floor, and the elevators can go up to (and including) the 4<sup>th</sup> building floor. If at any time an elevator is outside of this range, you should interpret it as the elevator "wrapping around". For example, if the program claims that elevator A is on floor -1, that means elevator A is actually on floor 4.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <i>n</i>, the number of following instructions. You can assume that 1 &le; n &le; 100.</p>
<p>Each following line contains an operation, the elevator to perform the operation on, and a parameter. If the operation ends in the letter "I" (upper case i), then the parameter is an integer in the range [0, 1000]. If the operation ends in "R", then the parameter is either the letter A or B. This parameter represents the current floor that elevator A or B rests on.</p>
<p>The possible instructions are setI, setR, addI, addR, subI, subR, mulI, mulR. These instructions will always appear with this exact capitalization.
The set operation will move the specified elevator to the parameter's value.
The add operation will add the parameter's value to the elevator's current floor.
The sub operation will subtract the parameter's value from the elevator's current floor.
The mul operation will multiply the specified elevator's floor by the parameter's value.</p>
<p>Remember that you should be wrapping the elevator's floor value after each operation. For example, if elevator A is currently on floor 2, and you encounter the instruction <b>addI A 3</b>, elevator A is now on floor 0.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>Your simulator should output two vertical lines, with the left line representing elevator A and the right line representing elevator B. The two lines are seperated by a space. A pipe character indicates an empty floor, and a pound sign represents the floor containing the elevator. In the example below, elevator A is on floor 4 and elevator B is on floor 0.</p>
